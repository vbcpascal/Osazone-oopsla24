# Bool

This is a simple language, introduced in Overview of the paper. This language is used to calculate boolean expressions, mainly defined by *if* of the host language.

An example program of Bool looks like

true and (false xor true)
```

See `sugars/Bool.sgs` for definition of the syntactic sugars. See `test.l` for example programs.
