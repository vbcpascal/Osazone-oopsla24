# CrossModelGeneration

This is a language extracted from MPS samples.

The original language is used to show *cross model generation* abilities of MPS, which is similar to separate compilation. Apart from that, the language is simply a definition of relations between entities. As shown in the example,
```
Entity Lily {
  mother of: Harry
  wife of: James 
}
```
an `Entity` `Lily` could be defined, with two relations to `Harry` and `James`.
