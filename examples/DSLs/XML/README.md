# XML

This example describes XML.

XML nodes could be elements or text. An element consists of a tag, some attributes and some child nodes. An attribute has a name and a value. These are defined as data types in the host language, MiniML, by the desugaring rule for the program entrance `Prog`.

Language constructs of XML inside the AST, are desugared into constructions of instances of these data types.
